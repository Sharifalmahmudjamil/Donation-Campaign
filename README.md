# Features
1.CreateBrowserRouter:  I should use CreateBrowserRouter to create a router for application. and using path and element.

2.Data Fetching: I am using the "useLoaderData" hook to fetch data. Ensure that it is working correctly and that the data is available as expected in the allData variable.

3.Local Storage: I am retrieving donation data from local storage using localStorage.getItem('donation'). Make sure that  I am storing this data correctly in local storage in another part of your application.
